# mosaics
**This project was made for the Fall 2019 semester of CS 225 at UIUC**

This program given an input image will create a mosaic using a bunch of additional images.

## Functionality
The goal of this project was to use kd trees and quick select in order to implement the nearest neighbor algorithm to find an image that is closest to a certain color of pixels on the input image. This is done for the whole image to create a mosiac.

## Contents
In this project the following files contained code that was written by me:
* maptiles.cpp
* maptiles.h
* kdtree.cpp
* kdtree.h

All other files were not written by me, but by the course staff of CS 225
